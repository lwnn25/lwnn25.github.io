Psychologists have been interested in this __1__ for decades, not least because people's widespread __2__ to ask for help has led to some high-profile failures.\n\nAsking for help takes __3__. It involves communicating a need on your part—there’s something you can’t do. __4__, you’re broadcasting your own weakness, which can be __5__. You might have __6__ about losing control of whatever it is you are asking for help with. __7__ someone starts to help, perhaps they will take over, or get a credit for your early efforts. Yet another __8__ that you might be worried about is being a nuisance or __9__ the person you go to for help.\n\nIf you struggle with low self-esteem, you might find it especially difficult to __10__ for help because you have the added worry of the other person __11__ your request. You might see such refusals as implying something __12__ about the status of your relationship with them. To __13__ these difficulties, try to remind yourself that everyone needs help sometimes. Nobody knows everything and can do everything all by themselves. And while you might __14__ coming across as incompetent, there’s actually research that shows that advice-seekers are __15__ as more competent, not less.\n\nPerhaps most encouraging of all is a paper from 2022 by researchers at Stanford University, in California, that involved a mix of contrived help-seeking interactions and asking people to __16__ times they’d sought help in the past. The findings showed that help-seekers generally underestimated how __17__ other people will be to help and how good it will make the help-giver feel (for most people, having the chance to help someone is highly __18__). So bear all this in mind the next time you need to ask for help. __19__, take care over who you ask and when you ask them. And if someone can't help right now, avoid taking it personally. They might just be too __20__, or they might not feel confident about their ability to help.`,

                    text: `U. S. customers historically tipped the people they assumed were earning most of their income via tips, such as restaurant serves earning less than the minimum wage. In the early 2010s, a wide range of business standard processing purchases with iPads and other digital payment systems. These system often prompted customers to tip for services that were not previously tipped.\n\nToday’s tip requests are often connected to the salary and service norms that used to determine when and how people tip. Customers in the past merely always pay the tips after receiving a service, such as at the conclusion of a restaurant meal after getting a haircut or once a pizza was delivered. That timing could reward high— quality service and give worthless an incentive to provide it. It's becoming more common for tips to be requested beforehand. And new tipping technology may even automatically add tips.\n\nThe prevalence of digital payment devices has made it easier to ask customers for a tip. That helps explain why tip requests are creeping into new kinds of services. Customers now routinely see menus of suggested default options -- often well above 20% of what they owe. The amounts have risen from 10% or less in the 1950s to 15% around the year 2000 to 20% or higher today. This increase is sometimes called tipflation -- the expectation of ever-higher tip amounts.\n\nTipping has always been a vital source of income for workers in historically tipped services, like restaurants, where the tipped minimum wage can be as low as US $ 2.13 an hour. Tip creep and tipflation are now further supplementing the income of many low-wage service workers.\n\nNotably，tipping primally benefits some of these workers such as cooks and dishwashers, so ensure that all employees were paid fair wages. Some restaurants banned tipping and increased prices, but this movement towards not-tipping services has largely fizzled out.\n\nSo to increase employee wages without raising prices, more employers are succumbing to temptations of tip creep and tip flation. However, many customers are frustrated because they feel they are being asked for too high of a tip too often. And, as our research emphasizes tipping now seems to be more coercive, less generous, and often completely disassociated from service quality.`,

                    text: `When it was established, the National Health Service(NHS) was visionary: offering high-quality, timely care to meet the dominant needs of the population it served. Nearly 75 years on, with the UK facing very different health challenges, it is clear that the model is out of date.\n\nFrom life expectancy to cancer and infant mortality rates, we are lagging behind many of our peers. With more than 6.8 million on waitlists, healthcare is becoming increasingly inaccessible for those who cannot opt to pay for private treatment; and the cost of providing healthcare is increasingly squeezing our investment in other public services. As demand for healthcare continues to grow, pressures on the workforce — which is already near breaking point — will only become more acute.\n\nMany of the answers to the crisis in health and care are well rehearsed. We need to be much better at reducing and diverting demand on health services, rather than simply managing it. Much more needs to be invested in communities and primary care to reduce our reliance on hospitals. And capacity in social care needs to be greater, to support the growing number of people living with long-term conditions.\n\nYet despite two decades of strategies and number of major health reforms, we have failed to make meaningful progress on any of these aims. That is why the Reform think tank is launching a new programme of work entitled “Reimagining health”, supported by ten former health ministers. Together, we are calling for a much more open and honest conversation about the future of health in the UK, and on “urgent rethink” of the hospital-centric model we retain.\n\nThis must begin with the question of how we maximise the health of the nation, rather than “fix” the NHS. It is estimated, for example, that healthcare accounts for only about 20% of health outcomes. Much more important are the places we live, work and socialise – yet there is no clear cross-government strategy for improving these social determinants of health. Worse, when policies like the national obesity strategy are scrapped, taxpayers are left with the heavy price tag of treating the illnesses, like diabetes, that result.\n\nReform wants to ask how power and resources should be distributed in our health system. What health functions should remain at the centre, and what should be given to local leaders, often responsible for services that create health, and with a much better understanding of the needs of their populations?`,

                    text: `Heat action plans, or HAPs, have been proliferating in India in the past few years. In general, an HAP spells out when and how officials should issue heat warnings and alert hospitals and other institutions. Nagpur's plan, for instance, calls for hospitals to set aside “cold wards” in the summer for treating heatstroke patients, and advises builders to give construction laborers a break from work on very hot days.\n\nBut implementation of existing HAPs has been uneven, according to a report from the center for Policy Research. Many lack adequate funding, it found. And their triggering thresholds often are not customized to the local climate. In some areas, high daytime temperatures alone might serve as an adequate trigger for alerts. But in other places, nighttime temperatures or humidity might be as important a gauge of risk as daytime highs.\n\nMumbai’s April heat stroke deaths highlighted the need for more nuanced and localized warnings, researchers say. That day’s high temperature of roughly 36°C was 1°C shy of the heat wave alert threshold for coastal cities set by national meteorological authorities. But the effects of the heat were amplified by humidity—an often neglected factor in heat alert systems—and the lack of shade at the late-morning outdoor ceremony.\n\nTo help improve HAPs, urban planner Kotharkar’s team is working on a model plan that outlines best practices and could be adapted to local conditions. Among other things, she says, all cities should create a vulnerability map to help focus responses on the populations most at risk. Such mapping doesn’t need to be complex, Kotharkar says. “A useful map can be created by looking at even a few key parameters.” For example, neighborhoods with a large elderly population or informal dwellings that cope poorly with heat could get special warnings or be bolstered with cooling centers. The Nagpur project has already created a risk and vulnerability map, which enabled Kotharkar to tell officials which neighborhoods to focus on in the event of a heat wave this summer.\n\nHAPs shouldn’t just include short-term emergency responses, researchers say, but also recommend medium- to long-term measures that could make communities cooler. In Nagpur, for example, Kotharkar’s team has been able to advise city officials about where to plant trees to provide shade. HAPs could also guide efforts to retrofit homes or modify building regulations. “Reducing deaths in an emergency is good target to have, but it’s the lowest target,” says Climate researchers Chandni Singh.`,

                    text: `Navigating beyond the organized pavements and parks of our urban spaces, desire paths are the unofficial footprints of a community, revealing the unspoken preferences, shared shortcuts and collective choices of humans. Often appearing as trodden dirt tracks through otherwise neat green spaces, these routes of collective disobedience cut corners, bisect lawns and cross hills, representing the natural capability of people (and animals) to go from point A to point B most effectively.\n\nUrban planners interpret desire paths as more than just convenient shortcuts; they offer valuable insights into the dynamics between planning and behaviour. Ohio State University allowed its students to navigate the Oval, a lawn in the centre of campus, freely, then proceeded to pave the desire paths, creating a web of effective routes students had established.\n\nYet, reluctance persists among other planners to integrate desire paths into formal plans, citing concerns about safety, environmental impact, or primarily, aesthetics. A Reddit webpage devoted to the phenomenon, boasting nearly 50,000 members, showcases images of local desire paths adorned with signs instructing pedestrians to adhere to designated walkways, underscoring the rebellious nature inherent in these human-made tracks. This clash highlights an ongoing struggle between the organic, user-driven evolution of public spaces and the desire for a visually curated and controlled urban environment.\n\nThe Wickquasgeck Trail is an example of a historical desire path, created by Native Americans to cross the forests of Manhattan and move between settlements quickly. This trail, when Dutch colonists arrived, was widened and made into one of the main trade roads across the island, known at the time as de Heere Straat, or Gentlemen's Street. Following the British assumption of control in New York, the street was renamed Broadway. Notably, Broadway stands out as one of the few areas in NYC that defies the grid-based system applied to the rest of the city, cutting a diagonal across parts of the city.\n\nIn online spaces, desire paths have sparked a fascination that can approach obsession, with the Reddit page serving as a hub. Contributors offer a wide array of stories, from little-known new shortcuts to long-established alternate routes.\n\nAnimal desire paths, such as ducks forging trails through frozen ponds or dogs carving direct routes in gardens, highlight the adaptability of these trails in both human and animal experiences. As desire paths criss-cross through both physical and virtual landscapes, they stand as a proof of the collective insistence on forging unconventional routes and embracing the spirit of communal choice.`,

But such feelings of connection markedly dip when entering a long gap.

The most striking feature is that outdoor activities are the most popular choice, accounting for a significant 45.3% of all pastimes.\n\nFollowing this, watching TV at home is the second most common activity, chosen by 23.8% of the seniors. Reading books and newspapers also constitutes a notable portion of their leisure time at 15.5%. Engaging in chess and card games is preferred by 10.4% of the elderly, while other miscellaneous activities make up the remaining 5%.\n\nFrom my perspective, this distribution reflects a positive trend towards active aging, as nearly half of the seniors prefer to spend their leisure time outdoors. This is beneficial for both their physical and mental well-being. However, the considerable percentage of time spent on sedentary activities like watching TV suggests a need for more diverse and engaging community programs. Encouraging more social and creative activities could further enrich the lives of the elderly and foster a stronger sense of community."
